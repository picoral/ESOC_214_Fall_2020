You need to make sure you are communicating your data analysis results in a way that makes sense to all of your stakeholders. Claus Wilke makes the point that the “goal in telling a story should be to use facts and logical reasoning” (Wilke 2019). That way, you not only make your point, but your point will be remember longer and better. 16.1 Types of stories Lead–Development–Resolution Action–Background–Development–Climax–Ending Opening–Challenge–Action–Resolution If you want more details about these, see Chapter 29 of Claus Wilke’s book(Wilke 2019). 16.2 Telling a story In this module, we will study how multiple tables and plots should be strung together in a story that illustrates the point you want to drive. The simplest way to tell a story is by presenting your visualizations in a challenge-resolution way. What’s the lead? What’s the development? What’s the resolution for the following data analysis? 16.2.1 How to tell the story library(janitor) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;janitor&#39; ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;: ## ## chisq.test, fisher.test library(knitr) library(tidyverse) ## ── Attaching packages ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.0 ── ## ✓ ggplot2 3.3.2 ✓ purrr 0.3.4 ## ✓ tibble 3.0.3 ✓ dplyr 1.0.2 ## ✓ tidyr 1.1.2 ✓ stringr 1.4.0 ## ✓ readr 1.3.1 ✓ forcats 0.5.0 ## ── Conflicts ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ── ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## x dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() women_labor_force_data &lt;- read_delim(&quot;data/women_in_labor_force.csv&quot;, delim = &quot;;&quot;) %&gt;% clean_names() ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## No = col_double(), ## Country = col_character(), ## `Level of development` = col_character(), ## `European Union Membership` = col_character(), ## Currency = col_character(), ## `Women Entrepreneurship Index` = col_double(), ## `Entrepreneurship Index` = col_double(), ## `Inflation rate` = col_double(), ## `Female Labor Force Participation Rate` = col_double() ## ) glimpse(women_labor_force_data) ## Rows: 51 ## Columns: 9 ## $ no &lt;dbl&gt; 4, 6, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 28, 3… ## $ country &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Austria&quot;, &quot;Belgium&quot;, &quot;Estonia&quot;… ## $ level_of_development &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Developed&quot;, &quot;Developed&quot;, &quot;Deve… ## $ european_union_membership &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Member&quot;, &quot;Member&quot;, &quot;Member&quot;, &quot;… ## $ currency &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Euro&quot;, &quot;Euro&quot;, &quot;Euro&quot;, &quot;Euro&quot;,… ## $ women_entrepreneurship_index &lt;dbl&gt; 54.9, 63.6, 55.4, 66.4, 68.8, 6… ## $ entrepreneurship_index &lt;dbl&gt; 64.9, 65.5, 60.2, 65.7, 67.3, 6… ## $ inflation_rate &lt;dbl&gt; 0.90, 0.60, -0.88, -0.20, 0.00,… ## $ female_labor_force_participation_rate &lt;dbl&gt; 67.10, 58.00, 68.50, 67.70, 60.… women_labor_force_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = level_of_development, y = inflation_rate)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_linedraw() + labs(x = &quot;Level of Development&quot;, y = &quot;Inflation Rate&quot;, title = &quot;Inflation by Development across different countries&quot;) women_labor_force_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(y = inflation_rate, x = entrepreneurship_index)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, formula = y ~ x) + theme_linedraw() + labs(x = &quot;Entrepreneurship Index&quot;, y = &quot;Inflation Rate&quot;, title = &quot;Inflation vs. Entrepreneurship&quot;) model_1 &lt;- women_labor_force_data %&gt;% lm(formula = inflation_rate ~ entrepreneurship_index) %&gt;% summary() model_1$coefficients %&gt;% kable() Estimate Std.

When you’re trying to show too much data at once you may end up not showing anything. When preparing a presentation or report, aim to use a different type of visualization for each distinct analysis. 16.4 FINAL PROJECT SUBMISSION Accept the final project submission on GitHub.
