(4,660 words, approx. 20 minutes of reading time) Watch the YouTube video Angry Hiring Manager Panel from 10:18 to 16:48 (6.5 minutes) and list the skills they mention as important to have in a data science position. Fill out Survey 1 (10 min) 2.2 What’s data science? Data science is one of the fields with the highest demand, with prospects of increased demand for the next decade (Kross et al. 2020; Hadavand, Gooding, and Leek 2018). Interestingly, the data scientist title was invented in 2008, and the median base salary for a data scientist surpassed $100,000 in the United States in 2019 (Robinson and Nolis 2020). Based on your own experience and on your reading for this module, in your groups discuss the following question: What is data science? 2.3 What does a data scientist do? Data science is an interdisciplinary field, and as such data scientists hold jobs with a broad range of skills, from statistics to communication. A quick search for data science jobs reveals this long list of skills. However, no single data scientist has all skills listed for different data science jobs. Instead, each data scientist specializes in different skills (Robinson and Nolis 2020). Make a list of skills listed on data science job announcements and in the video you just watched. Based on these, discuss the following questions in your group: Which skills do you already have? At what level of proficiency? Which skills are you interested in developing further? Based on the skills you already have, and the skills you want to acquire, what type of job in data science would you be interested in? 2.4 Data Science Workflow The basic data science workflow involve three main parts: The Question: Form the question you want to answer. Many times you will be given a question, and you have to “translate” it so you can answer it with your data analysis. Data Acquisition: data file, database, or web API Data Wrangling: import + tidy data + transform (Grolemund and Wickham 2018) Data Exploration: transform + visualize + model + repeat (Grolemund and Wickham 2018) Results Communication: visualize + write + knit (Grolemund and Wickham 2018) Figure 2.1: typical data science project model (Grolemund and Wickham, 2018) In your groups, based on your own intuition and experience, and based on the Introduction to R for Data Science book (Grolemund and Wickham 2018), summarize what each of the following steps means: Tidy Transform Visualize Model Communicate We will approach the entire data science workflow in this course (but not necessarily every step listed), not in this order. We start with step 3 (Data Wrangling) and 4 (Data Exploration), before we address step 2 (Data Acquisition) and step 5 (Communication) Go back to the list of skills and job positions we discussed (based on the reading and the video): Which steps in the data science workflow correspond to the job skills we talked about? 2.5 Before class #2 Please fill out Survey 1 (10 min). Reading: Data Science examples (1,0333 words, 8 min) Reading: Data Intake (1,686 words, 12 min) 2.6 What’s data? In your small group, discuss the examples provided in the excerpt from “Executive Data Science” (Caffo, Peng, and Leek 2016). How is this definition of Data Science different from other definitions we discussed so far? Why did Netflix end up not implementing the best solution from the Netflix prize challenge? What data was used in each of the examples provided? What is data? (come up with a definition). Examples of what data might look like.
