<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Course Description</h2>
<p>This course provides an introduction to the various skills and considerations required for data management and analysis in business, education, and science. Particular attention will be given to learning how to use the free and open-source computing environment R, as well as one of its data visualization packages, ggplot2.</p>
<p><strong>Upon completion of this course, students should be able to:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Understand data science as a process</p></li>
<li><p>Think critically about how data are stored, used, managed, analyzed, and presented</p></li>
<li><p>Engage in computational thinking and modeling</p></li>
<li><p>Experiment with skills required for large-scale data analysis</p></li>
</ol>

<div id="a-few-words-on-r-and-coding" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> A Few Words on R and Coding</h2>
<p>This course will be based around the programming language R which we will use within the integrated development environment (IDE) R Studio. For many of you this will be the first time programming, <strong>AND THAT’S OK! This course is intended for beginners, and we will actively focus on building up your R skills over the course of the semester</strong>. Of course, there will still be challenges along the way, but you will rapidly figure out how to solve your own problems as well as to apply your current knowledge to new and exciting questions. If you are struggling I highly encourage you to take advantage of my free help sessions (see times above). Of course, Google is always a super helpful way to get insight into coding problems. Our class Slack channel will also be there so you can help each other out.</p>
<p>I also want to note that I highly encourage you to help each other, as data scientists are rarely working in isolation. <strong>This does not mean you can directly share code associated with an assignment (this is a violation of UA’s Code of Academic Integrity)</strong>. What it does mean is that it is helpful to talk to each other about problems you encountered, resources you found, or provide helpful tips.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> A Few Words on Technology</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>YOU MUST BRING YOUR LAPTOP TO CLASS EVERY DAY! We will be actively coding in R on a daily basis, and not bringing your computer will severely hamper your learning. If you do not have a laptop or yours had troubles at some point during the semester, the library offers fast and free rentals of both macs and PC’s: <a href="https://new.library.arizona.edu/tech/borrow" class="uri">https://new.library.arizona.edu/tech/borrow</a>. You can also take advantage of the multiple computer labs on campus: <a href="https://it.arizona.edu/service/oscr-computer-labs" class="uri">https://it.arizona.edu/service/oscr-computer-labs</a></p></li>
<li><p>You will have access to and will be required to retrieve all course materials from the course page in D2L. Please prepare now for this experience by familiarizing yourself with D2L, the web-based courseware supporting this course. Training for D2L can be found online at: <a href="http://help.d2l.arizona.edu/students" class="uri">http://help.d2l.arizona.edu/students</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You will need to have R and R Studio installed and functioning by the second day of class. We will go over what these programs are and how to install them on day 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Piazza participation is critical! If you are having a coding issue, first try and solve it on your own. If you’re still struggling, then post it to Piazza. Essentially, if you are about to email me with a homework/class/coding question, post it to Piazza first. I’m not doing this to save me time, but rather because virtually all programmers/coders solve problems by helping each other, and thus I want you to do the same! Please go here to register for our course Piazza: piazza.com/arizona/fall2019/esoc214</p></li>

<div id="readings" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Readings</h2>
<p>There is no required textbook for this class. A few times we will use the book “R for Data Science” by Hadley Wickham and Garret Grolemund. This book covers how to create full data science pipelines in R (more than we’ll be doing here) and is available free here: <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/" class="uri">https://r4ds.had.co.nz/</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from this books, there will be other required readings. I will link these readings for you on this bookdown. Some come from academic journals, and others are news articles that appear in many of the newspapers you read in print and online. It is crucial that you read all assigned readings to do well in this class. Anyone who has not done the reading will simply not be able to participate.</p>

<p>60-69% = D “falls short of requirements/expectations”</p>
<p>&lt; 60% = E “repeat of course needed”</p>
<p><strong>A Note About Final Grades</strong></p>
<p>I do not modify final grades. I have designed this course to be highly passable for the new learner assuming they do the modest homework assignments, come to class, and participate. I’m not a difficult grader, and I build in extensive opportunities for ‘easy points.’ Given all this, please do not try and ask for a higher grade when end of semester rolls around.</p>
</div>
<div id="requirements-for-the-course" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> Requirements for the Course</h2>
<p>To succeed in this course, 2-3 hours of study time per hour of formal class time (or per unit) are required. This means that in addition to our three hours of formal class meeting time, 6-9 hours a week of study time are needed in order to meet course expectations. These hours should be spent on reading texts, working on your data challenges, researching for new information, or thinking about course content.</p>
<p><strong>It’s important to mention that each lesson builds upon the previous, and thus staying on top of the material is critical to your success.</strong> As mentioned before, this class is built specifically for beginners, and plenty of students who have never coded before have done extremely well. But, the reason they did is that they came to class consistently, asked questions when they had an issue, and completed their data challenges. If you miss a class, come to office hours to make up what you missed. I will do everything possible to make sure you succeeded assuming you’re willing to put in the work!</p>
</div>
<div id="course-schedule" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.7</span> Course Schedule</h2>
<p>Here is the tentative course schedule. <strong>Data challenges are always due before the start of class on the associated due date</strong>. There will sometimes be other short readings and assignments. These will be posted on D2L directly after the class period in which they are assigned.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.8</span> Final Project</h2>
<p>There is a final project in place of a final exam for this class. You will find your own dataset that helps you answer a question that you’re interested in. You’ll bring these data into R, explore it, clean it, make features, and run an analysis that allows you to answer your question. You will be graded on the completed R script as well as your presentation of the data.</p>
<p>The presentation will last 3-4 minutes, and will take place on the day of the final exam (in place of the exam). University policy on final examinations can be found here: <a href="https://www.registrar.arizona.edu/courses/final-examination-regulations-and-information" class="uri">https://www.registrar.arizona.edu/courses/final-examination-regulations-and-information</a></p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.9</span> Honors Students’ Requirements</h2>
<p>Students wishing to take this course for Honors Credit should email me to set up an appointment to discuss the terms of the contact and to sign the Honors Course Contract Request Form. The form is available at <a href="https://www.honors.arizona.edu/sample-contracts" class="uri">https://www.honors.arizona.edu/sample-contracts</a>. Students earning credit with the University of Arizona Honors College will be held to the following enhancements:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Honors students will be required to create an academic poster based on their final project, and then present this poster at the iSchool’s iShowcase at the end of the semester. Creating a poster will require extra work to ensure clarity of logic, having a well-defined question and approach, and the creation of quality visuals. Guidelines on how to create an engaging academic poster can be found here: <a href="https://guides.nyu.edu/posters" class="uri">https://guides.nyu.edu/posters</a>. Note: The iShowcase is at the end of the semester, but before finals when the regular class will have the project due. Thus, you will have to be ahead of schedule a bit to meet your honors requirement.</p></li>
<li><p>Honors students will also be expected to informally ‘journal’ about the course each week. Each week, that is, students will be required to write a five-sentence paragraph reflecting on some issue or moment that has arisen in our readings or discussions (e.g., the problem with particular terms or some philosophical or practical dilemma). Ultimately, if offering a paragraph each week, honors students will have written roughly 15 reflective paragraphs for the semester. This must be emailed directly to me by Sunday 5pm each week.</p></li>
