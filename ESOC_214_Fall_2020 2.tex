\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

This course provides an introduction to the various skills and considerations required for data management and analysis in business, education, and science. Particular attention will be given to learning how to use the free and open-source computing environment R, as well as one of its data visualization packages, ggplot2.

\textbf{Upon completion of this course, students should be able to:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Understand data science as a process
\item
  Think critically about how data are stored, used, managed, analyzed, and presented
\item
  Engage in computational thinking and modeling
\item
  Experiment with skills required for large-scale data analysis
\end{enumerate}

This course is designed to be interactive and hands-on.

\hypertarget{a-few-words-on-r-and-coding}{%
\section{A Few Words on R and Coding}\label{a-few-words-on-r-and-coding}}

This course will be based around the programming language R which we will use within the integrated development environment (IDE) R Studio. For many of you this will be the first time programming, \textbf{AND THAT'S OK! This course is intended for beginners, and we will actively focus on building up your R skills over the course of the semester}. Of course, there will still be challenges along the way, but you will rapidly figure out how to solve your own problems as well as to apply your current knowledge to new and exciting questions. If you are struggling I highly encourage you to take advantage of my free help sessions (see times above). Of course, Google is always a super helpful way to get insight into coding problems. Our class Slack channel will also be there so you can help each other out. You might want to watch \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFaWxxzouCY}{Roger Peng's video on how to get help}, which contains guidelines on what information to provide when asking a question in a public forum.

I also want to note that I highly encourage you to help each other, as data scientists are rarely working in isolation. \textbf{This does not mean you can directly share code associated with an assignment (this is a violation of UA's Code of Academic Integrity)}. What it does mean is that it is helpful to talk to each other about problems you encountered, resources you found, or provide helpful tips.

Learning to code nowadays is much easier, since a simple Google search will research in a huge amount of code that can solve any number of problems. You may use online resources (e.g., StackOverflow), but we will go over the syntax needed to solve all assignments in class. If you do use any external resources, you must explicitly cite where the code was obtained in your comments (add a direct link to the resource). I'll be checking for recycled code, and any code you re-used without a proper citation will be treated as plagiarism.

\hypertarget{a-few-words-on-technology}{%
\section{A Few Words on Technology}\label{a-few-words-on-technology}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  YOU MUST HAVE ACCESS TO A COMPUTER YOU CAN CODE WITH IN EVERY CLASS! We will be actively coding in R on a daily basis, and not being able to follow along will severely hamper your learning. If you do not have a laptop or yours had troubles at some point during the semester, the library offers fast and free rentals of both macs and PCs: \url{https://new.library.arizona.edu/tech/borrow}. You can also take advantage of the multiple computer labs on campus: \url{https://it.arizona.edu/service/oscr-computer-labs}
\item
  You will have access to and will be required to retrieve all course materials from the course page on GitHub.
\item
  You will need to have R and R Studio installed and functioning by the second day of class. We will go over what these programs are and how to install them in the first week of class.
\item
  Slack participation is critical! If you are having a coding issue, first try and solve it on your own. If you're still struggling, then post it to our Slack. Essentially, if you are about to email me with a homework/class/coding question, post it to Slack first. I'm not doing this to save me time, but rather because virtually all programmers/coders solve problems by helping each other, and thus I want you to do the same! Please \href{https://join.slack.com/t/ischool-esoc214/shared_invite/zt-gbmjw9oz-8hcl5iuktuYYdsamAkPVQA}{register for our Slack channel}.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{readings}{%
\section{Readings}\label{readings}}

There is no required textbook for this class. A few times we will use the book ``R for Data Science'' by Hadley Wickham and Garret Grolemund. This book covers how to create full data science pipelines in R (more than we'll be doing here) and is available free here: \url{https://r4ds.had.co.nz/}.

Aside from this book, there will be other required readings. I will link these readings for you on this bookdown. Some come from academic journals, and others are news articles that appear in many of the newspapers you read in print and online. For each reading, a word count and an approximate reading time will be provided. Please adjust these approximations to your own reading time, so you can plan accordingly.

It is crucial that you read all assigned readings to do well in this class. Anyone who has not done the reading will simply not be able to participate.

Late assignments within 24 hours of due date and time will get a 20\% grade penalty. Assignments submitted 24 hours after the due date and time will not get any credit.

If you are unable to complete an assignment on the due date due to an illness or another personal problem, please contact me as soon as possible so we can talk about ways to help you complete that assignment.

Grade Distribution:

90-100\% = A ``exemplary, far beyond reqs/expectations''

80-89\% = B ``exceeds requirements/expectations''

70-79\% = C ``meets requirements/expectations''

60-69\% = D ``falls short of requirements/expectations''

\textless{} 60\% = E ``repeat of course needed''

\textbf{A Note About Final Grades}

I do not modify final grades. I have designed this course to be highly passable for the new learner assuming they do the modest homework assignments, come to class, and participate. I'm not a difficult grader, and I build in extensive opportunities for `easy points.' Given all this, please do not try and ask for a higher grade when end of semester rolls around.

\hypertarget{requirements-for-the-course}{%
\section{Requirements for the Course}\label{requirements-for-the-course}}

To succeed in this course, 2-3 hours of study time per hour of formal class time (or per unit) are required. This means that in addition to our three hours of formal class meeting time, 6-9 hours a week of study time are needed in order to meet course expectations. These hours should be spent on reading texts, working on your data challenges, researching for new information, or thinking about course content.

\textbf{It's important to mention that each lesson builds upon the previous, and thus staying on top of the material is critical to your success.} As mentioned before, this class is built specifically for beginners, and plenty of students who have never coded before have done extremely well. But, the reason they did is that they came to class consistently, asked questions when they had an issue, and completed their data challenges. If you miss a class, come to office hours to make up what you missed. I will do everything possible to make sure you succeeded assuming you're willing to put in the work!

\hypertarget{course-schedule}{%
\section{Course Schedule}\label{course-schedule}}

Here is the tentative course schedule. \textbf{Data challenges are always due before the start of class on the associated due date}. There will sometimes be other short readings and assignments. These will be posted on D2L directly after the class period in which they are assigned.

\hypertarget{final-project}{%
\section{Final Project}\label{final-project}}

There is a final project in place of a final exam for this class. You will find your own dataset that helps you answer a question that you're interested in. You'll bring these data into R, explore it, clean it, make features, and run an analysis that allows you to answer your question. You will be graded on the completed R script as well as your presentation of the data.

The presentation will last 3-4 minutes, and will take place on the day of the final exam (in place of the exam). University policy on final examinations can be found here: \url{https://www.registrar.arizona.edu/courses/final-examination-regulations-and-information}

\hypertarget{honors-students-requirements}{%
\section{Honors Students' Requirements}\label{honors-students-requirements}}

Students wishing to take this course for Honors Credit should email me to set up an appointment to discuss the terms of the contact and to sign the Honors Course Contract Request Form. The form is available at \url{https://honors.arizona.edu/academics/honors-contracts}. Students earning credit with the University of Arizona Honors College will be held to the following enhancements:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Honors students will be required to create an academic poster based on their final project, and then present this poster at the iSchool's iShowcase at the end of the semester. Creating a poster will require extra work to ensure clarity of logic, having a well-defined question and approach, and the creation of quality visuals. Guidelines on how to create an engaging academic poster can be found here: \url{https://guides.nyu.edu/posters}. Note: The iShowcase is at the end of the semester, but before finals when the regular class will have the project due. Thus, you will have to be ahead of schedule a bit to meet your honors requirement.
\item
  Honors students will also be expected to informally `journal' about the course each week. Each week, that is, students will be required to write a five-sentence paragraph reflecting on some issue or moment that has arisen in our readings or discussions (e.g., the problem with particular terms or some philosophical or practical dilemma). Ultimately, if offering a paragraph each week, honors students will have written roughly 15 reflective paragraphs for the semester. This must be emailed directly to me by Sunday 5pm each week.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{code-of-conduct}{%
\section{Code of Conduct}\label{code-of-conduct}}

This code of conduct is based on \href{https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines}{GitHub Community Guidelines}. One of the goals of this course is to get you familiar with the data science community, and how people work and learn better together. This is a community we build together, and we need everybody's help to make it better each day.

\hypertarget{our-pledge}{%
\subsection{Our Pledge}\label{our-pledge}}

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as instructor and students pledge to making participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Be welcoming and open-minded.} Although this is an intro course, like in any other learning setting, we have people at different levels of experience. Other people may not have the same experience level or background as you, but that doesn't mean they don't have good ideas to contribute. I encourage you to be welcoming to everyone, from more advanced coders to those just getting started. We can all learn from each other.
\item
  \textbf{Respect each other.} Nothing sabotages healthy conversation like rudeness. Be civil and professional, and don't post or say anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech. Don't harass or grief anyone. Treat each other with dignity and consideration in all interactions.
\end{itemize}

You may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. That's fine. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Avoid name-calling, ad hominem attacks, responding to a post's tone instead of its actual content, and knee-jerk reactions. Instead, provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Communicate with empathy.} Disagreements or differences of opinion are a fact of life. Being part of a community means interacting with people from a variety of backgrounds and perspectives (and we are all better because of this variety), many of which may not be your own. If you disagree with someone, try to understand and share their feelings before you address them. This will promote a respectful and friendly atmosphere where people feel comfortable asking questions, participating in discussions, and making contributions.
\item
  \textbf{Be clear and stay on topic.} The goal of this course is to learn about data science and how to do data science with R. Off-topic comments are a distraction (sometimes welcome, but usually not) from getting work done and being productive. Staying on topic helps produce positive and productive discussions.
\end{itemize}

Additionally, as this class will be conducted online, you might not have met each other in person. Communicating on the internet can be awkward, even when you already know people. It's hard to convey or read tone, and sarcasm is frequently misunderstood. Try to use clear language, and think about how it will be received by the other person.

\hypertarget{our-standards}{%
\subsection{Our Standards}\label{our-standards}}

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Using welcoming and inclusive language
\item
  Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
\item
  Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
\item
  Focusing on what is best for the community
\item
  Showing empathy towards other community members
\end{itemize}

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
\item
  Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
\item
  Public or private harassment
\item
  Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
\item
  Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{enforcement}{%
\subsection{Enforcement}\label{enforcement}}

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting your instructor at \href{mailto:adrianaps@email.arizona}{\nolinkurl{adrianaps@email.arizona}}. Your instructor will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. Your instructor is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

\hypertarget{attribution}{%
\subsection{Attribution}\label{attribution}}

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the \href{https://www.contributor-covenant.org/}{Contributor Covenant}, version 1.4, available at \url{http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4}

\hypertarget{how-to-ask-for-help}{%
\section{How to Ask For Help}\label{how-to-ask-for-help}}

We'll see in this course that a key skill that you should develop as a data science is the ability to find solutions to problems. Knowing how to get help is part of that skill.

\hypertarget{before-you-ask-for-help}{%
\subsection{Before You ask for help}\label{before-you-ask-for-help}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Check for typos.} One of the most common causes of errors are typos, which usually throw an error such as {Error in \_\_\_\_\_ : could not find function ``\_\_\_\_\_''} due to a function being misspelled
\item
  \textbf{Check loaded packages.} You also get errors like {Error in data \%\textgreater\% summary() : could not find function ``\%\textgreater\%''} when you failed to load a package.
\item
  \textbf{Read the error message.} Don't ignore what R is telling you. Be aware that red text that appears in your console is not alwayws indication of errors. Sometimes it's just a warning.
\item
  \textbf{Google is your friend.} Copy and paste the exact error message on a Google search. (this step also includes \textbf{read the documentation} on the package you're trying to use).
\item
  If you are still stuck, you an always try \textbf{rubber duck debugging}. Describe the problem aloud, explaining it line-by-line, to a rubber duck or another person (who might not have any experience with programming of data science). This is also a good preparation step to asking other people for help (next section).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{ask-other-people-for-help}{%
\subsection{Ask other people for help}\label{ask-other-people-for-help}}

Like mentioned before, you should ask your peers for help before you ask your instructor. Relying on a single person to solve all of your problems is dangerous, because that person won't be available throughout your career as a data scientist.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Check \href{https://ischool-esoc214.slack.com}{\textbf{our Slack}} to see if someone else has asked a question similar to yours, and whether there's a solution posted for it.
\item
  \textbf{Be precise and informative}. The more context you can provide about what you're trying to do and what errors you're getting, the better. Also describe the steps you took to try to solve the problem yourself.

\section{What's data science?}\label{whats-data-science}}

Data science is one of the fields with the highest demand, with prospects of increased demand for the next decade \citep{kross2020democratization, hadavand2018can}. Interestingly, the data scientist title was invented in 2008, and the median base salary for a data scientist surpassed \$100,000 in the United States in 2019 \citep{robinson_nolis_2020}.

\leavevmode\hypertarget{challenge}{}%
Based on your own experience and on your reading for this module, in your groups discuss the following question:

  What is data science?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{what-does-a-data-scientist-do}{%
\section{What does a data scientist do?}\label{what-does-a-data-scientist-do}}

Data science is an interdisciplinary field, and as such data scientists hold jobs with a broad range of skills, from statistics to communication. \href{https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS843US843\&sxsrf=ALeKk02S5o7eqMYtn1l_VE-dvUDmZjXxKw:1594738746865\&ei=OsgNX8ObNMSD9PwP6JS2gAM\&q=data+science+jobs\&oq=data+science+\&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAxgAMggIABCxAxCRAjIICAAQsQMQkQIyAggAMgUIABCxAzIECAAQQzICCAAyBQgAELEDMgUIABCxAzIHCAAQsQMQQzIFCAAQsQM6BAgAEEc6BQgAEJECOggIABCxAxCDAToKCAAQsQMQgwEQQ1C3S1icVWDgYGgAcAN4AIABjwGIAcwKkgEDOC41mAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpeg\&sclient=psy-ab\&ibp=htl;jobs\&sa=X\&ved=2ahUKEwj2vc_qgM3qAhXEZs0KHTpaC8EQiYsCKAF6BAgKEBA\#htivrt=jobs\&htidocid=cxgsZF4SHt5PJepoAAAAAA\%3D\%3D\&fpstate=tldetail}{A quick Google search for data science jobs} reveals this long list of skills. However, no single data scientist has all skills listed for different data science jobs. Instead, each data scientist specializes in different skills \citep{robinson_nolis_2020}.

\leavevmode\hypertarget{challenge}{}%
Make a list of skills listed on data science job announcements and in the video you just watched. Based on these, discuss the following questions in your group:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Which skills do you already have? At what level of proficiency?
\item
  Which skills are you interested in developing further?
\item
  Based on the skills you already have, and the skills you want to acquire, what type of job in data science would you be interested in?
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{data-science-workflow}{%
\section{Data Science Workflow}\label{data-science-workflow}}

The basic data science workflow involve three main parts:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  The Question: Form the question you want to answer. Many times you will be given a question, and you have to ``translate'' it so you can answer it with your data analysis.
\item
  Data Acquisition: data file, database, or web API
\item
  Data Wrangling: import + tidy data + transform \citep{grolemund2018r}
\item
  Data Exploration: transform + visualize + model + repeat \citep{grolemund2018r}
\item
  Results Communication: visualize + write + knit \citep{grolemund2018r}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}

\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Tidy
\item
  Transform
\item
  Visualize
\item
  Model
\item
  Communicate
\end{enumerate}

We will approach the entire data science workflow in this course (but not necessarily every step listed), not in this order. We start with step 3 (Data Wrangling) and 4 (Data Exploration), before we address step 2 (Data Acquisition) and step 5 (Communication)

Install R and RStudio.

We are using RStudio as our IDE for this course. If you are running your R code in your computer, you need to install both R and RStudio. Alternatively, you can create a free account at \url{http://rstudio.cloud} and run your R code in the cloud. Either way, we will be using the same IDE (i.e., RStudio).

\leavevmode\hypertarget{explanation}{}%
What's an \textbf{IDE}? IDE stands for \textbf{i}ntegrated \textbf{d}evelopment \textbf{e}nvironment, and its goal is to facilitate coding by integrating a \textbf{text editor}, a \textbf{console} and other tools into one window.

  Open RStudio

  Check your R version by entering \texttt{sessionInfo()} on your console.
\item
  The latest release for R was June 22, 2020 (R version 4.0.2 Taking Off Again). If your R version is older than the most recent version, please follow step 1 in the previous section to update R.
\item
  Check your RStudio version, if your version is older than Version 1.3.x, please follow step 2 in the previous section to update RStudio.
\end{enumerate}

\leavevmode\hypertarget{explanation}{}%
How often should I update R and RStudio? Always make sure that you have the latest version of R, RStudio, and the packages you're using in your code to ensure you are not running into bugs that are caused by having older versions installed in your computer.

When \href{https://community.rstudio.com/t/should-i-update-all-my-r-packages-frequently-yes-no-why/5856/4}{asked}, \href{https://community.rstudio.com/u/jennybryan}{Jenny Bryan} summarizes the importance of keeping your system up-to-date saying that ``You will always eventually have a reason that you must update. So you can either do that very infrequently, suffer with old versions in the middle, and experience great pain at update. Or admit that maintaining your system is a normal ongoing activity, and do it more often.''

~

You can ensure your packages are also up-to-date by clicking on ``Tools'' on your RStudio top menu bar, and selecting ``Check for Packages Updates\ldots{}''

\hypertarget{why-learn-r}{%
\section{Why learn R?}\label{why-learn-r}}

R is both a programming language and \href{https://www.r-project.org/}{a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics}. In addition to being free, here are other reasons to learn R:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{R is popular.} According to \href{http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/}{Robert A. Muenchen's post on the popularity of data science software} (which is updated frequently), R is among the top 5 technologies that are mentioned in data science job ads on indeed.com.
\item
  \textbf{R is very powerful and versatile}. From creating websites (like this bookdown you're reading right now) to building machine learning models, R has it all.
\item
  \textbf{The R community is active and very supportive}. Because R is so popular, there are a number of forums on R. A good way to get a glimpse on how active the R community is to follow \href{https://twitter.com/search?q=\%23rstats}{\texttt{\#rstats}} on twitter.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{why-use-rstudio}{%
\section{Why use RStudio?}\label{why-use-rstudio}}

You can just use R, but RStudio is an IDE that makes using R easier and more fun. Some features that make RStudio the IDE that many data scientists use:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  RStudio is \textbf{free} and \textbf{open source}.
\item
  RStudio contains a full-feature integrated text editor, with tab-completion, spellcheck, etc.
\item
  RStudio is a cross-platform interface that looks the same across platforms.
\item
  RStudio allows you to organize your data science projects so you're not always hunting for the right script that goes with the data you want to analyze. (also, it integrates nicely with \texttt{rmarkdown} and \texttt{knitr})
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{create-an-r-project}{%
\section{Create an R Project}\label{create-an-r-project}}

In today's class, we will focus on situating ourselves around our IDE. For every lesson, we will either start a new R project or open an R project we've been working on.

Why create a RStudio project? RStudio projects make it easier to keep your projects organized, since each project has their own working directory, workspace, history, and source documents. In other words, it's much easier to open an R project and not have to worry about setting your working directory than to try to hunt down your files.

\leavevmode\hypertarget{steps}{}%
Here are the steps we are starting with today:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Start a new R project
\item
  Create a new R script
\item
  Save that R script as 01-class\_one
\end{enumerate}

You will rarely work with individual numeric values, or even individual numeric vectors. Often, we have information organized in dataframes, which is R's version of a spreadsheet.

Let's go back to my imaginary pet's ages (make sure you have the correct vector in your global environment).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my_pets_ages <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{8}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'3'}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{my_pets_ages <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{as.numeric}\NormalTok{(my_pets_ages)}

\hypertarget{slicing-you-dataframe}{%
\section{Slicing you dataframe}\label{slicing-you-dataframe}}

There are different ways you can slice or subset your dataframe.

You can use indices for rows and columns.

So far the \texttt{my\_pets} dataframe has two columns: name and age.

Let's add a third column with the pets' ages in human years. For that, we are going to use \texttt{\$} on with a variable (or column) name that does not exist in our dataframe yet. We will then assign to this variable the value in the \texttt{age} column multiplied by 4.

Coding style refers to how you name your objects and functions, how you comment your code, how you use spacing throughout your code, etc. If your coding style is consistent, your code is easier to read and easier to debug as a result. Here's some guides, so you can develop your own coding style:

\hypertarget{what-are-r-packages}{%
\section{What are R Packages?}\label{what-are-r-packages}}

An R package contains functions, and it might contain data. There are a lot of R packages out here (check the Comprehensive R Archive Network, i.e., CRAN, for a \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html}{full list}). That is one of the beautiful things about R, anyone can create an R package to share their code.

\hypertarget{installing-packages}{%
\section{Installing Packages}\label{installing-packages}}

The function to install packages in R is \texttt{install.packages()}. We will be working with \href{https://www.tidyverse.org/}{TidyVerse} extensively in this course, which is a collection of R packages carefully designed for data science.

Open your RStudio. In your console, enter the following to install tidyverse (this may take a while).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"tidyverse"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You need to install any package only once (remember to check for new package versions and to keep your packages updated). However, with every new R session, you need to load the packages you are going to use by using the \texttt{library()} function (a library is an installed R package in your computer).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(tidyverse)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\leavevmode\hypertarget{explanation}{}%
Note that when calling the \texttt{install.packages()} function you need to enter the package name between quotation marks (e.g., ``tidyverse''). When you call the \texttt{library()} function, you don't use quotation marks (e.g., tidyverse).

\hypertarget{before-you-load-your-data}{%
\section{Before You Load your Data}\label{before-you-load-your-data}}

Although we are working within an R project, which sets the working directory automatically for you, it's good practice to check what folder you are working from by calling the \texttt{getwd()} function.

We are going to create a \texttt{data} folder in our project, to keep things organized. Today we will be working with \href{https://www.kaggle.com/groundhogclub/groundhog-day}{a data set that contains groundhog day forecasts and temperature}. I cleaned up this data set already (no need for data tidying for now).

You can now list the contents of your \texttt{data} folder with the \texttt{dir()} function with a string that specifies the folder as a parameter.

Here's what we will focus on answering today, which is an excerpt from the \href{https://www.kaggle.com/groundhogclub/groundhog-day}{Groundhog Day Forecasts and Temperatures} kaggle page.

``Thousands gather at Gobbler's Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on the second day of February to await the spring forecast from a groundhog known as Punxsutawney Phil. According to legend, if Phil sees his shadow the United States is in store for six more weeks of winter weather. But, if Phil doesn't see his shadow, the country should expect warmer temperatures and the arrival of an early spring.''

So, in summary, our question is \textbf{How accurate is Punxsutawney Phil's winter weather forecast?}

\hypertarget{load-data-with-tidyverse}{%
\section{Load Data with Tidyverse}\label{load-data-with-tidyverse}}

We will use the \texttt{read\_csv()} function from the \texttt{readr} package (which is part of \texttt{tidyverse}) to read data in. Be careful, there's a similar function that is read.csv() from base R. We do want to use the function with the \texttt{\_} (i.e., \texttt{read\_csv()})

The pipe allows us to apply multiple functions to the same object.

Let's start by selecting one column in our data.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{groundhog_predictions }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(Punxsutawney_Phil)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## # A tibble: 122 x 1
##    Punxsutawney_Phil
##    <chr>            
##  1 No Record        
##  2 No Record        
##  3 No Record        
##  4 Full Shadow      
##  5 No Record        
##  6 Full Shadow      
##  7 Full Shadow      
##  8 No Record        
##  9 Full Shadow      
## 10 Full Shadow      
## # ... with 112 more rows
\end{verbatim}

Now let's add another pipe to get unique values in this column.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{groundhog_predictions }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(Punxsutawney_Phil) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{unique}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## # A tibble: 4 x 1
##   Punxsutawney_Phil
##   <chr>            
## 1 No Record        
## 2 Full Shadow      
## 3 No Shadow        
## 4 Partial Shadow
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{counting-categorical-variables}{%
\section{Counting Categorical Variables}\label{counting-categorical-variables}}

One of the functions I most use when exploring my data is \texttt{count()}, which you can combine with \texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{groundhog_predictions }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{count}\NormalTok{(Punxsutawney_Phil)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## # A tibble: 4 x 2
##   Punxsutawney_Phil     n
##   <chr>             <int>
## 1 Full Shadow         100
## 2 No Record             6
## 3 No Shadow            15
## 4 Partial Shadow        1
\end{verbatim}

You can do the same adding \texttt{group\_by()} to your pipeline.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{groundhog_predictions }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(Punxsutawney_Phil) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{count}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## # A tibble: 4 x 2
## # Groups:   Punxsutawney_Phil [4]
##   Punxsutawney_Phil     n
##   <chr>             <int>
## 1 Full Shadow         100
## 2 No Record             6
## 3 No Shadow            15
## 4 Partial Shadow        1
\end{verbatim}

And instead of \texttt{count()} we can use the \texttt{summarise()} and \texttt{n()} functions.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{groundhog_predictions }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(Punxsutawney_Phil) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarise}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{total =} \KeywordTok{n}\NormalTok{())}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## # A tibble: 4 x 2
##   Punxsutawney_Phil total
##   <chr>             <int>
## 1 Full Shadow         100
## 2 No Record             6
## 3 No Shadow            15
## 4 Partial Shadow        1
\end{verbatim}

\leavevmode\hypertarget{challenge}{}%
This last way of counting categorical variables (with \texttt{summarise()} and \texttt{n()}) outputs a data frame that is slightly different from the previous too. What's the difference?

\hypertarget{group_by-summarise}{%
\section{group\_by + summarise}\label{group_by-summarise}}

The combination of the \texttt{group\_by()} and \texttt{summarise()} functions is very powerful. In addition to using the \texttt{n()} function to count how many rows per each category in our categorical variable, we can use other functions with numeric (i.e., quantitative) variable such as \texttt{sum()} and \texttt{mean()}.

\leavevmode\hypertarget{challenge}{}%
Take a moment to revisit the question we want to answer.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  What do we want to find out?
\item
  How can we answer our question with this data?
\item
  What function (e.g., \texttt{sum()}, \texttt{max()}, \texttt{mean()}) do we use to answer our question? With what variables/columns?
\end{itemize}

Complete the code below.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{groundhog_predictions }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(Punxsutawney_Phil) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{summarise}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{total =} \KeywordTok{n}\NormalTok{(),}
            \DataTypeTok{____ =} \KeywordTok{____}\NormalTok{(____))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Example of output that you might want to get to answer our question:

\begin{verbatim}
## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## # A tibble: 4 x 4
##   Punxsutawney_Phil total feb_mean_temp mar_mean_temp
##   <chr>             <int>         <dbl>         <dbl>
## 1 Full Shadow         100          33.7          41.7
## 2 No Record             6          31.4          39.1
## 3 No Shadow            15          35.6          43.0
## 4 Partial Shadow        1          30.7          41.3
